# THIS PROJECT IS **NOT** COMPLETE. DO NOT USE FOR ANY PURPOSE RIGHT NOW. I REPEAT, IT IS **NOT** COMPETE.

The PixelNet is a pseudo-centralized p2p botnet that attempts to dynamicize the P2P bootstrapping process by using existing IRC networks to dynmically create a bootstrap channel in said IRC network with a dynamic pattern defined by a pseudo-random seed.
