# The-Pixelnet

# THIS PROJECT IS **NOT** COMPLETE. DO NOT USE FOR ANY PURPOSE RIGHT NOW. I REPEAT, IT IS **NOT** COMPETE.

The PixelNet is a pseudo-centralized p2p botnet that attempts to dynamicize the P2P bootstrapping process by using existing IRC networks to dynmically create a bootstrap channel in said IRC network with a dynamic pattern defined by a pseudo-random seed. 

For the imports, and by extension the program, to work, you must use Python 3.9 and run the drone_base.py script to start up the bot. Running individual modules does not work.
## By utilizing this program or any piece of it, you understand that this program is for educational use only.
